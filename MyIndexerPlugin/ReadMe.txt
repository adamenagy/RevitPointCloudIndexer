 MyIndexerPlugin
-----------------

This sample shows how you can index your own point cloud file format, 
i.e. turn it into a *.pcg file that Autodesk products can open.

The project contains two User Macros to make things easier:

$(RVTPROGRAM) = C:/Program Files/Autodesk/Revit Architecture 2012/Program/ 
$(RVTSDK) = C:/Revit SDK 2012/

If on your system these values are not correct, then inside Visual Studio 2010 you 
can go to View >> Property Manager, then double-click on the Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user entry
and under User Macros you'll find them and can modify them. 
Or you can also define Environment Variables.  

The project is a simple Win32 DLL project with the extra files added inside the Reader folder,
and an include folder added under 
Project Properties >> Configuration Properties >> VC++ Directories >> Include Directories 

To debug the project, you can just set the following values under 
Project Properties >> Configuration Properties >> Debugging: 

Command = $(RVTPROGRAM)AdPointCloudIndexer.exe
Command Arguments = "$(ProjectDir)Demo Head - Point Cloud.ASC" "$(ProjectDir)Demo Head - Point Cloud.pcg"
